        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I thought that by choosing Computer Science, I was already ahead of the game and had my future planned out.
            But each time I look at a screen full of errors, I am reminded that I am still on a path of discovery to learn who I am and who I want to become. As a Computer Science major, my path in life is not just about learning how to code.
            It is about learning how I think, learning how I solve problems, and learning how I can grow from failure. This blog is about the career that I see for myself in the next five years and the person that I am building one line of code at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>Where I See Myself in the Next Five Years</h2>
        <p>
            In five years, I do not see myself as a flawless programmer who never commits errors.
            Rather, I envision myself as someone who comprehends errors and knows how to
            convert confusion into solutions. I would like to apply my skills in an area where
            problem solving is important, whether it is programming, systems analysis, or
            developing tools that simplify daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a CS major, I find the logic involved in programs more appealing than just
            making things look good. I enjoy learning why something works, rather than
            just knowing it works. In five years, I hope to be part of a team where my
            ideas count and where I continue to learn.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills I Know I Still Need to Build</h2>
        <p>
            Honest with myself, I realize that coding alone is not sufficient. I still need to
            work on my problem solving skills, particularly when faced with overwhelming tasks.
            There are times when algorithms puzzle me or when my program works but I don’t
            understand why. These are the times when I realize that I still have much to
            learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to technical skills like data structures, algorithms, and programming languages, communication skills are also necessary. I need to improve my skills in explaining my logic, asking questions, and collaborating with others. In the real world, code does not exist by itself.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Think Companies Look For in CS Graduates</h2>
        <p>
            According to what I have learned, it is not only that companies seek a person who can
            write code quickly. They also seek people who can think clearly, be able to adapt to
            new situations, and continue to learn. As a CS student, I think that it is more
            important to be curious and persistent rather than being perfect. Companies want
            students who do not give up when they encounter problems but instead learn from
            their mistakes.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Looking forward, my future in Computer Science is a little uncertain but very exciting. It is like a piece of code that is yet to be optimized. The most important thing I have learned is that learning is not about knowing everything. Learning is about being open to experiencing, learning, failing, and trying again. In five years, I might still be debugging, but I would be doing it with more confidence, more experience, and more purpose.
