    </header>

    <main class="bucket-section">

        <h2 class="section-title">⭐ The Goals</h2>

<div class="bucket-grid">
    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🎓 Graduate</h3>
        <p>Earn my Computer Science degree and close the chapter on years of late night debugging, caffeine fueled days. And walk across that stage knowing I've built the foundation for everything that comes next.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>💼 Find Work</h3>
        <p>Land a role in cybersecurity or game development at a company that actually shapes the industry think Sony, Valve, or HoYoverse. I want to contribute to projects that millions of people interact with daily, protecting systems or crafting worlds that players lose themselves in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🌏 Travel</h3>
        <p>Immerse myself in cultures completely different from my own wander through Tokyo's neon lit streets at midnight, share meals with strangers who become friends, get lost in cities where I don't speak the language, and collect stories from every corner of the globe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🖥️ Dream Setup</h3>
        <p>Construct the ultimate battlestation triple monitors glowing with code, a VR rig that transports me to other worlds, and a full sim racing cockpit with force feedback that makes every turn feel real. Basically a space where creativity and competition collide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🇯🇵 Learn Japanese</h3>
        <p>Reach fluency enough to watch anime raw without missing a single nuance or joke lost in translation, navigate Japan's countryside without Google Translate as a crutch, and hold genuine conversations that go beyond tourist phrases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🏔️ Do One "Out of Comfort Zone" Adventure</h3>
        <p>Skydiving from 15,000 feet. Scuba diving into the silent deep. Solo traveling through unfamiliar territory. Something that triggers that primal fight or flight response the kind of adrenaline that comes from living, not from coding prjects at 3 AM.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🎮 100% Complete 50 Games</h3>
        <p>No guides for the final achievements. No cheese strategies. Just raw dedication to mastering every system, finding every secret, and earning that platinum trophy through persistence and skill. A testament to patience in an age of instant gratification.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🌟 Build Something That Outlives Me</h3>
        <p>Create a piece of software, or a tool that continues solving problems long after I've moved on. Something open source that other developers fork and improve, or a product thousands depend on daily digital immortality through utility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🎵 Learn One Instrument</h3>
        <p>Master the guitar to balance the rigid logic of coding with the fluid emotion of music. Evolve beyond being just a systematic thinker into a soulful creator, channeling feelings and stories that refuse to fit inside lines of code or rigid algorithms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>✈️ Experience Fighter Jet Flight</h3>
        <p>Strap into a Grumman F 14 Tomcat or something equally legendary and feel the raw power of military aviation G forces pressing me into the seat, the roar of twin engines, and the surreal sensation of velocity that makes everything on the ground seem frozen in time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🏎️ Drive on a Real Racetrack</h3>
        <p>Trade the sim rig for actual asphalt helmet strapped tight, hands on a real wheel, heart hammering as I apex corners at speeds that would lose my license on public roads. Whether it's piloting an F1 machine or sliding a Formula Drift car, I want to know what real limits feel like.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bucket-item">
        <h3>🤖 Pilot a Real Mech</h3>
        <p>If humanity ever builds true mechanized walkers, I want to be among the first to climb into that cockpit. Feel the hydraulic hum beneath my seat as tons of steel and circuitry respond to my every movement. Master the neural link or manual controls that turn human intention into crushing footsteps and thunderous motion. Whether it is a sleek Gundam soaring through space with beam sabers drawn or a massive Jaeger standing tall against kaiju threats, I want to experience what it means to become something larger than life. To tower over skylines, feel the ground shake with each step I command, and know the impossible weight of piloting a machine that exists only in dreams right now.</p>
