            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Previously, when I heard the term AI, I associated it with something very distant, such as robotic films or genius level technology. However, as a current computer science student, I understand that AI is currently sitting alongside me as I write codes, research, as well as panic when deadlines are near.
              As an individual, I have experienced the effects of AI on learning and problem solving activities.
              At times, it really works well, and at other times, it leaves me a little stressed.
              This blog is going to be about how AI influences our lives in technology regardless of whether we are paying attention or not.

            <h3>AI as My Silent Study Buddy</h3>
            <p>
              Being a computer science student, AI is now a regular part of my life even if I didn’t deliberately incorporate it into my routine. When I get stuck in my coding mistake or in some concepts, I usually consult AI to help me understand. Hindi na ako agad sumusuko kapag may error sa code because of AI as it assists me to comprehend the error. It’s not like it’s giving answers to my questions, as if I were following instructions from a guiding figure along the way.

            <h3>How AI Changed the Way I Learn</h3>
            <p>
              Learning felt so slow and frustrating before AI. I depended only on notes, Google searches, or asking classmates. Now, it feels more interactive. I get to ask my questions in my own words even Taglish and still get those explanations that make sense. Still, I remind myself not to rely on it too much. I need to think on my own.

            <h3>AI in Real Computer Science Work, Not Just School</h3>
            <p>
              One aspect of AI that really resonated with me is its application not only in an educational environment but also as a current tool used by people with real programming skills. To be honest, AI has shown me how drastically the world of technology is changing, which excites me but also pressurizes me because I realize how much I must better my skills as a programmer. AI taught me that when it comes to programmers, it’s hard for anyone to replace them easily unless they learn how to use AI successfully.

            <h2>Conclusion / Reflection</h2>
            <p>
               AI has actually become a part of my tech journey, whether I want it to or not. It assists me in learning faster, thinking deeper, and observing how technology is constantly changing in real life. The greatest lesson I have gained from AI is that it should be utilized as a technology and never as a shortcut. In the future, I will utilize AI technology to enhance my knowledge and never as a substitute for hard work myself because, as a computer science student, I believe that being able to utilize AI and never fight it will be a very valuable lesson for me.
